# Score

_Score_ is a platform-agnostic specification for defining environment configuration for cloud based workloads

The _Platform CLI_ is a tool to synchronize your specification against your platform specific environment.

## Installation

Use the homebrew formula to install the _Platform CLI_.

**score-compose**

```bash
brew install score-compose
```

## Repositories

## Overview

The Score specification file resolves configuration drift between environments. Compose a `score.yaml` file that describes how to run your workload. As a platform-agnostic declaration file, `score.yaml` creates a single source of truth on workload profiles of requirements and works to integrate with any platform or tooling.

### Use the Platform CLI tool

```bash
# Generate compose.yaml with caws-compose
score-compose run -f /tmp/caws.yaml -o /tmp/compose.yaml

# Run the service with docker-compose
score-compose -f /tmp/compose.yaml up backend
```

## Score manifesto

- Enable local development without risk of configuration inconsistencies in remote environments.
- Establish a single source of truth for application configuration.
- Separate environment specific from environment agnostic configuration.
- Enable agnostic declaration of infrastructure dependencies.
- Abstract away complexity without sacrificing transparency.
- Make each program do one thing well. Build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.
- Make each program do one thing well. Build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.
- Offer sensible defaults while allowing for a large degree of customization.
- As a developer, you shouldnâ€™t have to worry about where your code is running.
