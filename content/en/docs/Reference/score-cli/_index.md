  Overview and description for the Score implementation (CLI).
---

The _Score implementation (CLI)_ is a command-line tool used to interact with a Score Specification. Use the Score implementation (CLI) to transform the platform-agnostic specification into multiple configuration files for the platform of your choice.

- [Set environment-specific configuration to run Workloads in a target environment]({{< relref "/docs/environment%20variables/_index.md" >}} "Set environment-specific configuration to run Workloads in a target environment.")

## The Score implementation (CLI)

Construct your Score implementation (CLI) commands such that the command options precede its path and arguments when provided.

```bash
score-[platform] [command] [flag]
```

Currently, supported platforms includes:

- `score-compose` the implementation of a Docker Compose configuration.
- `score-helm` the implementation of a Helm Chart configuration.
- `score-humanitec` the implementation of a Humanitec configuration.

## Command reference

The Score implementation (CLI) has two distinct parts.

- **Commands**: The commands are tasks you want Score to do. Supply Score with commands and subcommands to execute specific tasks.
- **Flags**: Flags, also called parameters, are options that modify the result of the _command_ by providing additional configurations. Flags are specific to the command, and each command can have independent flags.

## Global modifiers

The following are a list of global modifiers.

### `--help`

Provides more information from the CLI.

Alias: `-h`

### `--version`

Alias: `-v`
