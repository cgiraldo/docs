## Develop your Score spec

To compose a Score Specification file, you'll do the following:

- Scope: identify containers, resources, and services needed for your infrastructure.
- Compose: compose your resources into the Score Specification file.
- Transform: transform your Score Specification file to the Platform of your choice.

## Getting started

To get started, you'll want to:

- Learn how to [install the Score implementation (CLI)]({{< ref "/install" >}} "Learn to install").
- Run your [first transformation]({{< ref "get started/../hello-world" >}} "Hello world").
- Review the [reference material]({{< ref "reference" >}} "Reference content").
