### macOS

We recommend installing the Score CLI with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index.html).
With Homebrew, you can access an extensive selection of libraries and applications, with their dependencies managed for you.

### Prerequisites

Install Homebrew according to the [official Homebrew installation instructions](https://brew.sh/index.html).

### To install Score on macOS:

1. Install Score by running `brew install score` from your terminal.
2. Verify Score is installed by running `score --version`.

### Linux

On the Linux operating systems, use the built-in package manager to install Score:

1. Open a terminal and run these commands to install the latest Score CLI from the officially maintained package archives:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:score
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install score
   ```

1. To verify that Score works on your computer, run:

   ```shell
