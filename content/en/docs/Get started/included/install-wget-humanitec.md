### Step 1. Download

Download with the CLI `wget` command.

```bash
wget https://github.com/score-spec/<score-platform>/releases/download/<x.y.z>/<score-platform>_<x.y.z>_<os_system>.tar.gz
```

- Replace `<score-platform>` with the name of the Score implementation tool.
- Replace `<x.y.z>` with the version number.
- Replace `<os_system>` with your operating system.

For example, the following `wget` command downloads `score-humanitec` for macOS.

```bash
wget https://github.com/score-spec/score-humanitec/releases/download/0.1.0/score-humanitec_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

Update the following example to include the path to your file.

```bash
tar -xvzf ~/<your-path>/<score-platform>_<x.y.z>_<os_system>.tar
