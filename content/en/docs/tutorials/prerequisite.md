## Install the Score implementation

As a prerequisite to each tutorial, you should have [installed the Score implementation (CLI)]({{< relref "/install" >}} "Learn to install").

## Install peripheral tools

The tutorials are hosted on GitHub. Because of this, you should have access to GitHub, a text editor, and access to the command line.

When working with the Score implementation, you should have the peripheral tools installed as well.

For example:

- If you're working with the `score-humanitec` tool, you should have a Humanitec account.
- If you're working with the `score-compose` tool, you should have Docker installed.
