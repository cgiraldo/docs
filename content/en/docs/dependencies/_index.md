  Describes how to set Workloads that are dependent on additional resources.

Dependencies are user-defined resources that describe the relationship between Workloads.

The Score Specification has a `resources` section that is used to describe Workload's dependencies. This mechanism can be used to spin-up multiservice setups with `docker compose`.

For example, `service-a.yaml` score file describes a service that has two dependencies: `service-b` (another workload) and a PostgreSQL database instance:

```yaml {linenos=false,hl_lines=["35-36"]}
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1

metadata:
  name: service-a

containers:
  service-a:
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo service-a: Hello $${FRIEND}! Connecting to ${CONNECTION_STRING}...; sleep 10; done"]
    variables:
      FRIEND: ${resources.env.NAME}
      CONNECTION_STRING: postgresql://${resources.db.user}:${resources.db.password}@${resources.db.host}:${resources.db.port}/${resources.db.name}

resources:
  env:
    type: environment
    properties:
      NAME:
        type: string
        default: World
  db:
    type: postgres
    properties:
      host:
        default: localhost
      port:
        default: 5432
      name:
        default: postgres
      user:
        secret: true
      password:
        secret: true
  service-b:
    type: workload
```

The second workload is described in the `service-b.yaml` file and doesn't have additional dependencies.

```yaml
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1

metadata:
  name: service-b

containers:
  service-b:
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo service-b: Hello $${FRIEND}!; sleep 5; done"]
    variables:
      FRIEND: ${resources.env.NAME}

resources:
  env:
    type: environment
    properties:
      NAME:
        type: string
        default: World
```

To prepare the Docker Compose configuration files, convert both Score files with `score-compose`.

```bash
score-compose run -f ./service-b.yaml -o ./service-b.compose.yaml
score-compose run -f ./service-a.yaml -o ./service-a.compose.yaml --env-file ./.env
```

Resulting output file `service-a.compose.yaml` would include two dependencies on compose services `db` and `service-b`.
Both should be up and running before `service-a` could start.

```yaml
services:
  service-a:
    command:
      - -c
      - 'while true; do echo service-a: Hello $${FRIEND}! Connecting to ${CONNECTION_STRING}...; sleep 10; done'
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_started
      service-b:
        condition: service_started
    entrypoint:
      - /bin/sh
    environment:
      CONNECTION_STRING: postgresql://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST-localhost}:${DB_PORT-5432}/${DB_NAME-postgres}
      NAME: ${NAME-World}
    image: busybox
```

Ensure there is a Docker Compose database service definition.
A common place to store non-Score defined configuration and resources is a root `compose.yaml` file.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```

Ensure the `.env` file has all the proper environment variables set.

```console
NAME=World
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
```

Now the files can be combined to build the application with `docker compose`.

```bash
docker compose -f ./compose.yaml \
  -f ./service-a.yaml \
  -f ./service-b.yaml \
  --env-file ./.env up
```

The following is the output of the previous command.

```bash
