  Use overrides as a method of sharing common configurations across environments.

By default, the Score implementation tool looks for a `score.yaml` file and overrides the declared defaults with in that file, if `overrides.score.yaml` exits.

The following Score implementations support passing an override file as an argument.

- `score-compose`
- `score-helm`
- `score-humanitec`

## Overview

If an `overrides.score.yaml` file is found, the {{< glossary_tooltip text="Score implementation (CLI)" term_id="platform-cli" >}} applies overrides on the output. This occurs whether a flag is provided or not.

Any property of Score segment can be overridden.

For example, the `score.yaml` file contains a configuration, however, the `overrides.score.yaml` file contains configuration overrides for new and existing services.

If a configuration option is defined in both the default `score.yaml` file and the `overrides.score.yaml` file, the default values are replaced with the overrides.

## Override a command

To override the defaults declared in your `score.yaml` file create a `overrides.score.yaml` file and declare your overrides.

1. Create a `score.yaml` file.

```yaml
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1
metadata:
  name: run-python-app

containers:
  my-service:
    image: python3
    command:
      - python
      - --version
```

<!-- https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#adding-and-overriding-configuration -->

2. Create an `overrides.score.yaml` file and declare an override.

```yaml
containers:
  my-service:
    command:
      - python
      - --help
```

1. Run the following command to override the default arguments by the `overrides.score.yaml` file.

```bash
score-compose run -f ./score.yaml \
  -o ./compose.yaml \
  --overrides ./overrides.score.yaml
```

The following is an example output of the previous command.

```yaml {linenos=false,hl_lines=["4-5"]}
services:
  run-python-app:
    entrypoint:
      - python
      - --help
    image: python3
```

**Results** You've successfully overridden the default configuration file with a command described in your `overrides.score.yaml` file.
