A _workload_ is a deployable application made up of one or more containers that runs in the same context and share resources, dependencies and networks.

The workload is a specification of how the container(s) should be run. For example, it might be run as a long-lived process - such as a microservice or application - or short-lived on demand - such as a cronjob or job. You may prefer to think of workloads as applications, programs, or processes if compared to non-cloud setups that run on a host or a virtual machine.
