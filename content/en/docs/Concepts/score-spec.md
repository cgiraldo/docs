The Score specification describes how to run a workload in the context of an application. It allows to specify which containers to use, whether resource or service dependancies exist, if ports are to be opened or what data volumes to reference - whatever it is that a workload requires to run, it is captured in the score.yaml specification file. As a platform-agnostic declaration file, the Score specification presents the single source of truth on a workloads profile of requirements and works to utilise any platform and tooling.
