The _Target Platform CLI_, or Platform CLI, is the implementation to convert the Score Specification into the target platform configuration file of your choice.

Each platform uses a separate CLI tool, for example:

- Docker compose: `score-compose`
- Helm: `score-helm`
- Humanitec: `score-humanitec`
