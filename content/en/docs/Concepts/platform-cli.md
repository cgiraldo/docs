The _Target Platform CLI_, or Platform CLI, is the implementation to convert the Score Specification into the target platform configuration file of your choice.

In line with Douglas McIlroy's [Unix philosophy](https://archive.org/details/bstj57-6-1899/page/n3/mode/2up), each tool has a distinct and focused purpose.

Each platform uses a separate CLI tool, for example:

- Docker compose: `score-compose`
- Helm: `score-helm`
- Humanitec: `score-humanitec`
