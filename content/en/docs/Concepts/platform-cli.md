The _Target Platform CLI_, or Platform CLI, is the implementation to convert the Score Specification into the target platform configuration file of your choice.

Following Unix philosophy, each Platform CLI has a distinct and focused purpose.
For example, each of the following tools are used to generate a corresponding configuration.

- `score-compose`, is used to generate Docker Compose files.
- `score-helm`, is used to generate a Helm Chart.
- `score-humanitec`, is used to generate a Humanitec delta.
