# Overview

This documentation site is built on Hugo.

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

From the repo root folder, run:

To use yarn.

```bash
yarn build
```

To use Hugo.

```bash
hugo server -D
```

## Troubleshooting documentation site builds

### Extended version of Hugo

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:

```bash
➜ hugo server

INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 Using config file:
Building sites … INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 syncing static files to /
Built in 288 ms
Error: Error building site: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): resource "scss/scss/main.scss_9fadf33d895a46083cdd64396b57ef68" not found in file cache
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of Hugo.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may encounter the following error:

```bash
➜ hugo server

Error: failed to download modules: binary with name "go" not found
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the `go` programming language on your system.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-go-language) of the user guide for instructions on how to install `go`.

### Failed to resolve output format `print`

When building the server, you may receive the following error message.

```bash
Error: from config: failed to resolve output format "print" from site config
error Command failed with exit code 255.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

To resolve this issue, delete the temporary Hugo cache directory. By default, [`-cacheDir`](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/) is stored at `$TMPDIR/hugo_cache`.

```bash
rm -rf $TMPDIR/hugo_cache
```

### `package-lock.json` locked files

When running `yarn`, you may receive the following error message.

```bash
warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.
```

To resolve this issue, delete the `package-lock.json` file.

```bash
rm package-lock.json
```
